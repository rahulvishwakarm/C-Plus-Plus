// Data and Information

Data:
1. Data is the Collection of raw and Unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols and description of things which does not carry any meaning.
2. When data is arranged in systematic way then it gets a structures and become meaningful.
3. Raw data are insufficent for decision making

Information
1. When data is processed, transformed and organised we get the information which help in making decision and have the logical meaning.
2. Information is sufficient for decision making


// Data Structure

Data Structure is systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently(In term of time and space).
Data Structure is the organization of the data in way so that it can be used efficiently. 

Real Life Example:
a. BitMap Image - Array Data Structure
b. Undo/Redo - Stack Data Structure
c. Connection in social media - Graph Data Structure


// User defined Data type - struct, union and enumeration
eg: struct point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };

// Abstract Data type

1. Data Structure is used to implement ADT.
2. ADT tells what to do and ADT tells whow to do
eg: Stack can be implmented using Array or Linked list.


// Types of Data Structure
1. Linear Data Structure - Data Structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in linear(sequential) order.
eg: Array, Stack, Queue and Linked list

2. Non Linear Data Structure - Data Structure is non linear when all the element are not arranged in a linear(sequential) order.
eg: Tree, Graph

3. Static Data Structure - In Static Data Structure memmory is allocated at the compile time. Therefore maximum size is fixed.
Advantage: Fast Access
Disadvantage: Slow insertiona and deletion
eg: Array

4. Dynamic Data Structure - In Dynamic Data Structure memory is allocated at the run time. Therefore maximum size is flexible
Advantage: Faster insertion and deletion
Disadvantage: Slow Access
eg: Linked list


// Asymptotic Notation

1. Efficiency - Efficiency of data structures is alaways measured in terms of TIME and SPACE
2. Ideal Data Structure - An Ideal Data Structure will be the Data Structure that consume least possible TIME and less memory SPACE.

// TIme Complexity

1. Running time of program depends upon the size of the input
2. f(n) is the number of instructions executed for the input value n
3. Exact running time is not the best solution for calculating the time complexity 
4. Time complexity depends upon the size of the input


// Big O notation

1. Big O notation is used to find the performance of any algorithm by providing the order of the growth of the function.
2. It gives the upper bond on the function by which we can assume that the function will never grow Faster then this upper bond.
3. Big O notation helps us to estimate the approximate run time of operations performed on the data structures.

if f(n) and g(n) are two function then:
    then f(n)=Og(n) if there exist constant c and n0 such that
        f(n) <= c*g(n)
        For all the value of n>=n0  

4. Big O notation helps us in finding the growth rate of function without plugging in different values of N.
5. Big O notation simplifies the function by eliminates the unnecessary terms which are not contributing much in over all run time.


// Guide Lines Related to Asymptotic Notation

1. Loops
a. Loops execute n times

2. Nested Loop 
a. Outer loop execute n times
b. Inner loop execute n times
c. Total time = n*n = O(n^2)


// Recursion
Recursion is the function which calls itself directly or indirectly
eg:
    int fun()
    {
        fun();
    }
